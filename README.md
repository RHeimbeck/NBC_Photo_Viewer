# NBC_Photo_Viewer
This is a demo web application for viewing image collections from the NBC servers.
The application retrieves a json description packet listing the url and meta-data for a collection of images.
It then builds-out html to show all the images along with the meta-data.
The app uses BootStrap for basic page sizing and media queries.  It also uses the BootStrap Modal plugin as the image viewer 
"Lightbox."
Install these files inside the public directory of a web server, and then navigate to http://<your host>/demo.html.
